# Analysis Summary

## What We Did
We analyzed historical supermarket sales data to understand sales patterns and predict future sales. Our dashboard:
- **Identified Trends**: Daily sales trends show fluctuations, with peaks often on weekends (see 'Daily Sales Trend').
- **Found Seasonal Patterns**: Sales vary by month, with higher averages in certain months (see 'Monthly Sales Seasonality').
- **Inferred Promotion Impact**: Without explicit promotion data, we observed higher sales on weekends and in specific months, suggesting possible promotional effects. Adding a 'Promotion' column to the dataset could improve this analysis.
- **Predicted Future Sales**: Using a Random Forest model, we forecasted sales for the next 3 months by product line (see 'Future Sales Prediction'). The model uses features like unit price, quantity, and customer behavior to predict total sales accurately.
- **Optimized Inventory**: Based on predictions, we recommended stock levels for each product line to avoid overstock (excess inventory) and stockouts (running out of products). Safety stock and reorder points ensure supply chain reliability (see 'Inventory Recommendations').

## How the Model Works
The Random Forest model predicts sales by learning from historical data, considering factors like:
- **Unit Price and Quantity**: Directly influence total sales.
- **Day of Week and Month**: Capture weekly and seasonal patterns.
- **Customer Type and Payment Method**: Reflect customer behavior.
The model was tuned for accuracy (see 'Sales Prediction Models') and used to forecast future sales, guiding inventory decisions.

## Why It Matters
This analysis helps Simba Supermarket:
- **Plan Inventory**: Stock the right amount of each product to meet demand without wasting resources.
- **Reduce Costs**: Avoid overstock (which ties up capital) and stockouts (which lose sales).
- **Boost Sales**: Prioritize high-performing products and time promotions effectively.
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Use predictions and trends to stay ahead of customer demand.

## Next Steps
- Add promotion data to the dataset to analyze their direct impact on sales.
- Monitor actual sales against predictions to refine the model.
- Adjust lead time and safety stock based on supplier reliability and demand variability.
